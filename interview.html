	<h2>Human Needs Not Apply</h2>

	<p>Developments in technology that have made life more efficient for humans and have stimulated the economy. Advancements in robotics are a threat to employment since robots have the capacity to complete most of the tasks we can in a more efficient manner. The clip also includes how self-driving are a much safer and errorless alternative will soon dominate the automobile industry. </p>
	<p>I believe that certain jobs cannot be fulfilled by robots. Human creativity and innovation is not something that can be replicated. As for physical labor jobs, humans will no longer be necessary as robots are superior and a cheaper choice.

	<p>The Global Position System (GPS) allows you to be located anywhere on the Earth in three different dimensions. This is done with the assistance of 24 satellites that are over 12,000 miles above the Earth. Phones have similar tracking systems, but they aren't as precise.</p>
	<p>Installation of Event Data Recorders in cars has become very popular in recent years. They are used as valid evidence in court to prove innocence and are insightful when investigating a car accident. They record data on speed, braking time, turn signal status, and seat belts. </p>
	<p>Small, seemingly useless fragments of information often connect to a bigger picture or conspiracy. This is a useful tool when analyzing crime. </p>

<h2>Interview</h2>
<p> 
What is the person you are interviewing's name? 
Gerald, my high school advisor. 
<p>

<p> How old were you when you got your first piece of techonology?
I was 6 years old. <p>

<p> What was your favorite piece of technology growing up? My nintendo 64 and the tv. They worked together. <p>

<p> How has technology changed over your lifetime?
They made it a lot better. Made things easier but distracting for some people. It made things easier for me than they were for my parents. My mom grew up inthe Phillipines without a car or phone. Having these things has made life easier. <p>

<p> Have the changes made in techonology mostly helped or hurt society?
It has helped. We are at the most advanced point in human history thus far and it will only continue to get better. We are able to cure most diseases and any piece of information can found through a series of clicks. Technology can be distracting but it is a very useful tool. <p>

<p> What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?
Increased space exploration. In my lifetime, I'd like to see a man land on Mars. <p>

<p> What advice would you like to give to younger generationgs regarding technology?
What is your greatest fear for techonology in the future?
Potential for wasted time. Phones are very distracting and can make people lazy. However, they can also be a tool for innovation. The choice is ours. <p>

<p> Try your best to be genuinely nice to other people. Treat people how you'd like to be treated. Don't use social media as a way to be mean to others. <p>
